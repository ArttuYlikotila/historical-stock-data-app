# Historical stock data app

This SPA-application provides some statistics about
historical stock data. App analyzes data from CSV-files
that must be downloaded from the website of Nasdaq and
then imported to the app.

When a user has imported a CSV-file to the app, they can
select a date range from that historical data that they
want to analyze. App offers three different statistics from
the data.

This responsive app is made with Create React App. 

Styling is made with Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS.
